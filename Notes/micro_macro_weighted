'micro': Calculate metrics globally by counting the total true positives, false negatives and false positives.

'macro': Calculate metrics for each label, and find their unweighted mean. This does not take label imbalance into account.

'weighted': Calculate metrics for each label, and find their average weighted by support (the number of true instances for each label). This alters ‘macro’ to account for label imbalance; it can result in an F-score that is not between precision and recall.
